**Easy Cheat Detector** is a free cheat scanner for Counter-Strike 1.6 that helps detect the use of prohibited modifications and third-party software that gives players an unfair advantage. The tool is designed as an alternative to anti-cheat systems. Ask suspicious players to run a scan, and the report will appear on our website https://fungun.net/ecd/
